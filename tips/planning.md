## Planning

### What is a plan?
A document to share information about a working item focused on decision making, in my experience a plan could contain information about these items, the detail, format and which items are omited/required changes from team to team
- Objectives
- Sub-items or related items that need to be completed
- Completion steps
- Risks and dependencies
- Contingency plans (if needed)
- Status
- Decisions
- Updates


### When do we make a plan?
- When you cannot remember, from the top of you head, the steps required to complete a working item
- When you work with othe people (even one more person)
- When someone making decisions or your manager wants/needs to know "what you are doing"

### How do we use a plan?
A plan is a conversation piece, is usefull to:
- Avoid unnecesary conversations
  - How is the working item going?
  - Are we on time?
  - Are there any risks?
  - Why did you do X?
- Direct necessary conversations
  - Is there anything required for the success on the completion of the working item?
  - Agreement on required interactions, dependencies and timelines
