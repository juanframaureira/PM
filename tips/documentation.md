## Documentation
Threat documentation as SW engineers treat code:
- A document need to have value (if not what are you doing working on it)
- Make it work -> Make it clean -> Automate it
- If it's perfect you overdid it

Documentation is anything written, this can be as simple as a line in you notes. In general, document things that are valuable and will be read.
> Make sure you are compliant with regulatory and security documentation, here the format **is** important
### Desicion Making
- Before building a plan, build enough documentation so you can decide how important a working item is compared to the rest
- If someone is looking into your desicion making, please sure to understand what they are looking for and document it
- Value people that reads what you publish but value more people that see what you deliver
### Documenting plans
- Plan with enough detail so **your team** understand *what they are doing*
- Plan with enough detail so **your customers** understand *why you are doing the things you are doing*
- Plan with enough detail so **the org** doesn't need to ask you *what you are doing and why*
- Make sure to document things that NEED to be done and review the list before deciding what to do next
- You can document things that "will be nice to do" but measure your expectations and the length of this list
